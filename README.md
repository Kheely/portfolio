## Description

The objective of my project is to use data I have collected from drone 
surveys and analyze for any trends in biodiversity or relative abundance of marine 
megafauna. I have data of flight logs, environmental parameters, and species 
detections. I will look to see if different environmental factors influence 
species detections. 

## Repository Structure
Three main folders within the repository:

- `data/`:
  - `data/raw`: contains two `*.csv` files downloaded from google sheets
  -`data/processed`: contains the cleaned version of my data
  -`data/output`: contains the data that is ready to be exported
- `scripts/`: R scripts for analysis
  - `scripts/01_processing`: contains one script that cleans, processes, and exports data
  - `scripts/02_analysis`:
  - `scripts/03_content`: 
- `results/`: contains figures
